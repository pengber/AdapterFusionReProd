# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Combining Pre-Trained Adapters using AdapterFusion

In [the previous notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Adapter-Hub/adapter-transformers/blob/master/notebooks/02_Adapter_Inference.ipynb), we loaded a single pre-trained adapter from _AdapterHub_. Now we will explore how to take advantage of multiple pre-trained adapters to combine their knowledge on a new task. This setup is called **AdapterFusion** ([Pfeiffer et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00247.pdf)).

For this guide, we select **CommitmentBank** ([De Marneffe et al., 2019](https://github.com/mcdm/CommitmentBank)), a three-class textual entailment dataset, as our target task. We will fuse [adapters from AdapterHub](https://adapterhub.ml/explore/) which were pre-trained on different tasks. During training, their represantions are kept fix while a newly introduced fusion layer is trained. As our base model, we will use BERT (`bert-base-uncased`).

## Installation

Again, we install `adapter-transformers` and HuggingFace's `datasets` library first:
"""

#!pip install -U adapter-transformers
#!pip install datasets

"""## Dataset Preprocessing

Before setting up training, we first prepare the training data. CommimentBank is part of the SuperGLUE benchmark and can be loaded via HuggingFace `datasets` using one line of code:
"""
import datasets
from datasets import load_dataset

# dataset = load_dataset("super_glue", "cb")
dataset = load_dataset("./data/super_glue/cb")

print(dataset.num_rows)

"""Every dataset sample has a premise, a hypothesis and a three-class class label:"""

dataset['train'].features

"""Now, we need to encode all dataset samples to valid inputs for our `bert-base-uncased` model. Using `dataset.map()`, we can pass the full dataset through the tokenizer in batches:"""

from transformers import BertTokenizer
model_path = './model/bert-base-uncased/'
model_name = model_path #'bert-base-uncased'
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)

def encode_batch(batch):
  """Encodes a batch of input data using the model tokenizer."""
  return tokenizer(
      batch["premise"],
      batch["hypothesis"],
      max_length=180,
      truncation=True,
      padding="max_length"
  )

# Encode the input data
dataset = dataset.map(encode_batch, batched=True)
# The transformers model expects the target class column to be named "labels"
dataset = dataset.rename_column("label", "labels")
# Transform to pytorch tensors and only output the required columns
dataset.set_format(type="torch", columns=["input_ids", "attention_mask", "labels"])

"""New we're ready to setup AdapterFusion...

## Fusion Training

We use a pre-trained BERT model from HuggingFace and instantiate our model using `BertModelWithHeads`.
"""

from transformers import BertConfig, BertModelWithHeads

id2label = {id: label for (id, label) in enumerate(dataset["train"].features["labels"].names)}

config = BertConfig.from_pretrained(
    model_path,
    id2label=id2label,
)
model = BertModelWithHeads.from_pretrained(
    model_path,
    config=config,
)

"""Now we have everything set up to load our _AdapterFusion_ setup. First, we load three adapters pre-trained on different tasks from the Hub: MultiNLI, QQP and QNLI. As we don't need their prediction heads, we pass `with_head=False, model_name=model_name` to the loading method. Next, we add a new fusion layer that combines all the adapters we've just loaded. Finally, we add a new classification head for our target task on top."""

"""The last preparation step is to define and activate our adapter setup. Similar to `train_adapter()`, `train_adapter_fusion()` does two things: It freezes all weights of the model (including adapters!) except for the fusion layer and classification head. It also activates the given adapter setup to be used in very forward pass.

The syntax for the adapter setup (which is also applied to other methods such as `set_active_adapters()`) works as follows:

- a single string is interpreted as a single adapter
- a list of strings is interpreted as a __stack__ of adapters
- a _nested_ list of strings is interpreted as a __fusion__ of adapters
